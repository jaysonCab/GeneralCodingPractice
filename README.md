        December 8th:
Created a repository for all my coding learning
Primarily leetcode questions and practice with data structures and algorithms

Worked on:
Stacks and Queues
Leetcode 14

Do more research on Hashmaps
Learn more about cores and threading


        December 15th: 
Writing custom scripts on terminal 
Wrote notes on it too

leetcode 20 + 21 are new, try and learn those linked lists and ways to use dicitonaries

        December 19th:
Array algorithms -->
Binary search: Run time of O(log n), finds a position value in a sorted list or returns -1 if not found || Leetcode quesiton 35

TOMORROW SEARCH QUESTION 35

bubble sort
selection sort !
insertion sort !
merge sort !
quick sort 
heap sort

        December 20th:
Practiced more just creating linked list, merge sort, and binary sort
Learning insertion sort

Those 4 scripts, I feel okay about will try again tomorrow for sure
I will try selection sort to end the day off

        December 21st:
Practice the same algorithms as yesterday, maybe in late afternoon get back on leetcode I think I can start doing array quesitons on leetcode. At least 1 and I will be happy !
Did question 35, that was simple. Goal is to complete one tomorrow as well.
Bubble sort today, tomorrow Quicksort is my goal too.
