        December 8th:
Created a repository for all my coding learning
Primarily leetcode questions and practice with data structures and algorithms

Worked on:
Stacks and Queues
Leetcode 14

Do more research on Hashmaps
Learn more about cores and threading


        December 15th: 
Writing custom scripts on terminal 
Wrote notes on it too

leetcode 20 + 21 are new, try and learn those linked lists and ways to use dicitonaries

        December 19th:
Array algorithms -->
Binary search: Run time of O(log n), finds a position value in a sorted list or returns -1 if not found || Leetcode quesiton 35

TOMORROW SEARCH QUESTION 35

bubble sort !
selection sort !
insertion sort !
merge sort !
quick sort 
heap sort

        December 20th:
Practiced more just creating linked list, merge sort, and binary sort
Learning insertion sort

Those 4 scripts, I feel okay about will try again tomorrow for sure
I will try selection sort to end the day off

        December 21st:
Practice the same algorithms as yesterday, maybe in late afternoon get back on leetcode I think I can start doing array quesitons on leetcode. At least 1 and I will be happy !
Did question 35, that was simple. Goal is to complete one tomorrow as well.
Bubble sort today, tomorrow Quicksort is my goal too.
Kanade's algorithm? What is that, is it well known

        December 22nd:
Working on Dutch national flag problem <-- Nice !

        December 23rd:
Woke up at 9:20 today, not good. Slept through alarms on purpose wasted so much time, especially since I have plans later today it's a write off :( Lets do our best !
Something about a sliding window?
Also futher practice on everything else.

So sets are O(1), thats pretty good. If the question asks, is this a new term? Normally I would append in a string, then check if X is in string. So instead, hashmap/lookup table O(1) nice.
setting = set()
dictionary = {}

Tonight, learn sliding window for set size I guess.
Then maybe tomorrow work on udnerstanding sets, memorize union, subtraction of a set, things like that

        December 24th, 2024
Dang, I keep messing up some of the simple sorts. Even Kadane and sliding window forget sometimes. Not good ! Just have to keep practicing the same stuff, all good. Worked on set sizes of sliding windows. Maybe I will do some set work rn since I wrote it yesterday.
The next on the list is two pointer, I think I've done questions like this already but its fine. Tomorrow is Christmas but I will still probbaly work on it.
Cool, 977 is a two pointer problem. I think two pointer problems are super cool !

        December 25th, 2024
I think I got everything down pat, I will still practice it for sure though. I think Ive worked on many linear traversal problems this whole time, I will go onto rotation of arrays and strings should be easy.

Theres a binary insertion sort which is just better than regular insertion sort apparently.

        December 26th, 2024
It might just be a quicksort angle learn later today. Im a bit busy today though, I have work so past 1 is when I can get started. It's 7:00am, I will just practice what I already learned and quicksort later. Maybe I can get radix sort done today too ? We will see.
Alright, 1:00pm time to get started
Mmm, quick sort requires recursion, I am not too understanding of it yet maybe I will calm it down.

        December 27th, 2024
Recursion eh? Hard concept, idk how to practice it well.

        December 28th, 2024
I have kind of slowed down, this recustion topic is getting harder.

I'll start with this series to understand it better

        December 29th, 2024
Recursive backtracking? I've never heard of this term before.
Ah, it's difficult. I think I will take the approach, learn the things I want to. I will learn trees next

        December 30th, 2024
Infix --> Regular bedmas layout of equation or expressions | Operand, operator, operand a + b * c
Pretfix --> Operator is before two operands | operator, operand, operand + a * bc --> Read from right to left
Postfix --> Operator is after two operands | operand, operand, operator abc *+ --> Read from left to right

        December 31st, 2024
No ! Today I watch videos on matricies, doing binary search on a matrix is something on the list

        January 28th, 2025
I want to work more on classes and objects in regards to API calls

        February 15th, 2025
Freshened up in coding for a bit, should get back to it eh

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things I should know:

Linked List

Binary Search
Merge Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Bubble Sort
Dutch national flag sorting

Kadane's algorithm

Sliding window of a variable sized array + fixed size

Set vs Dicitonary/Hashmap
